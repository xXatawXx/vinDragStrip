# vinDragStrip

Depends on : https://github.com/xXatawXx/polyzones, https://github.com/overextended/qtarget & https://github.com/JayMontana36/mythic_notify-1

Basic 2 player drag strip race script I made a while back, around this time I was just returning to fivem and decided to start writing lua again, made the barberscript after this I think, but still rusty so that's a plus, don't go reselling this as your own please that's lame ;c.

Tip: Don't be like me and try to clean and write your code all at the same time, it's fine to write spaghetti and clean it up later otherwise you'll take half a day sitting here and cleaning XD.
